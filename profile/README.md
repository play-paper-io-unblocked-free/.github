## What is Paper io?

At first glance, it might look like a simple game: move your colored square and draw loops to capture land. But behind that clean design is a game of calculated risk, lightning-fast decisions, and strategic aggression.

Leave your safe zone to claim new ground—but beware: your trail is vulnerable. If an enemy crosses it before you return, you're done. That constant balance between bold moves and careful play is what makes each match unpredictable and addictively tense.

## Tips from a Paper io Veteran

Here’s what I’ve learned from way too many games:

### 1. Take It Slow at First
Don’t rush to claim big areas early on—your trail will be an easy target. Build a solid base first.

### 2. Watch Other Players' Moves
When someone overextends or leaves a long trail unguarded—take them out.

### 3. Stay Near the Map Edges
You’re less likely to get flanked if you stick to the sides, especially when starting out.

### 4. Quick Turns Save Lives
Practice making tight, fast turns to dodge attacks or snap back to safety.
